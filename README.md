# Walkthrough of the FrontendMaster's CSS Intro Course.

* WIP

Decided to refresh some fundamentals, proven to be very useful from time to time

This is just sort of a draft for my personal portfolio website.
It isn't ready yet, but somewhat presentable.

1. Utilizes FlexBox, some basic Grid, it is adaptive
2. Semantic HTML, accessible, icon links have `aria-label` on them. Skip link is also available
All images have `alt` attribute filled in, focusable elements have color indication.
3. Added `prefers-colors-scheme: dark` to the whole page
